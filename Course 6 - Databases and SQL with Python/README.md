## About this Project

**This Course** introduced relational database concepts and helped me to learn and apply foundational knowledge of the SQL language. I leared all the basic commands and functions of SQL such.  

**The emphasis in this course** is on hands-on and practical learning. As such,I have worked with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. I created a database instance in the IBM DB2 cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs I practiced building and running SQL queries. I also learned how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python with the help of Ibm_db or sqlite3 API..

## Final Course Assignment
This folder contains datasets, in-class Jupyter lab Notebooks, Peer Graded Assignment and Honors Assignment.

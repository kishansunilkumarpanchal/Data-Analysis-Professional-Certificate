# Python Project for Data Science <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roshangrewal/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certification/master/IBM-Banner.png" align="right" width="120" />


## About this Project
For this project, We assumed the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. I extracted financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data I visualized it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks I worked with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

## Course Structure

- [x] **Intro to Web Scraping Using BeautifulSoup**

In this lab I learned how to use BeautifulSoup and specifically how to extract data in HTML tables to a DataFrame. 
* **Environment Setup**
```python
!pip install bs4
!pip install requests
```

---

- [x] **Extracting Stock Data Using a Python Library**

In this lab, I used a Python library to obtain financial data. I extracted historical stock data using yfinance. I have also completed a graded quiz with 100% marks in first attempt.

* **Environment Setup**
```python
!pip install yfinance
!pip install pandas
```

- [x] **Extracting Stock Data Using Web Scraping**

In this lab I used web scraping to obtain financial data. I extracted historical stock data from a web-page using beautiful soup. I have also completed a graded quiz with 100% marks in first attempt.

* **Environment Setup**
```python
!pip install pandas
!pip install requests
!pip install bs4
!pip install plotly
```

- [x] **Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard**

Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it, is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. 
In this assignment, I extracted stock data for Tesla and GameStop, then I displayed this data in a graph with the help of plotly library.

* **Environment Setup**
```python
!pip install yfinance
!pip install pandas
!pip install requests
!pip install bs4
!pip install plotly
```
